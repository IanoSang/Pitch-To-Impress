                            No more than 30 seconds in length (it should be short enough to cover in an elevator ride, hence its name), itâ€™s a type of sales pitch that every sales professional should have up their sleeve.

You'll go in-depth and emphasize how your product works, how it will solve their pain points, and the specific benefits it will bring to your customers.
